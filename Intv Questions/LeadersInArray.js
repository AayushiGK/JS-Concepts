// Find all Leaders in an Array
// Easy :  Microsoft, Amazon, Adobe, Goldman Sachs

// Given an integer array X[] of size n, write a program to find all the leaders in the array X[]. An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right side.
//   The last element of an array is a leader by default.
//   The largest element of an array is also a leader by default.
//   Suppose all the array elements are unique.
//   Ordering in the output doesnâ€™t matter.

const arr = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2];
// output : [ 17, 5, 2]
