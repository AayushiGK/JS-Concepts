// Search in a 2D Matrix
// Easy :  Microsoft, Amazon, Adobe, Directi, Goldman Sachs, SAP, Visa.

// You are given a row-wise and column-wise sorted 2D matrix and an integer k, write a program to find whether the integer k is present in the matrix or not. The matrix has the following properties:
// Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
// The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
// Suppose all matrix values are unique.

const findNumber = 6;
// const findNumber = 20; // Test Case 2
// const findNumber = 35; // Test Case 3
const arr = [
  [1, 2, 6, 7],
  [14, 13, 15, 21],
  [23, 35, 36, 45],
];
