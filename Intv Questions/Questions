Find Equilibrium Index of an Array.
Easy : Amazon, Adobe, Hike.
Write a program to find the equilibrium index of an array. The equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes.
Input: A[] = [-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0], Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is an equilibrium index, i.e., A[0] + A[1] + A[2] = A[4] + A[5] + A[6] = -1.

Product of array except self
Medium : Facebook, Amazon, Morgan Stanley
Given an array X[] of n integers where n > 1, write a program to return an array product[] such that product[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of X except X[i].
Input: X[] = [2, 1, 3, 4], Output: product[] = [12, 24, 8, 6]
Explain :
Product except the 1st element = 1 _ 3 _ 4 = 12
Product except the 2nd element = 2 _ 3 _ 4 = 24
Product except the 3rd element = 2 _ 1 _ 4 = 8
Product except the 4th element = 2 _ 1 _ 3 = 6

Rotate Matrix 90-Degree
Medium : Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Morgan Stanley
Given an n x n square matrix, write a program to rotate the matrix by 90 degrees in the anti-clockwise direction. The goal is to perform the matrix rotation in place, meaning we need to rotate the matrix without using extra space.
Input = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
output = [[3,6,9],[2,5,8],[1,4,7]]

Print Matrix in Spiral form
Medium : Microsoft, Amazon
Given a 2-dimensional matrix, print all the elements in spiral order.
Input = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
output = 1 2 3 6 9 8 7 4 5

Sort 0s, 1s and 2s Without using Extra Space
Medium : Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Paytm, Morgan Stanley, Hike, Walmart, Adobe, SAP Labs, Qualcomm
Given an array X[] consisting of 0s, 1s, and 2s, write a program to sort the array of 0’s, 1’s, and 2’s in ascending order.
Input: X[] = [0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0], Output: X[] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]

Sort an Array in a Waveform
Easy : Google, Amazon, Adobe
Given an unsorted array of n integers, write a program to sort the array into a wave array. An array A[n] is sorted in wave arrangement if A[0] >= A[1] <= A[2] >= A[3] <= A[4] >= ….
Input: A[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: A[] = [2, 1, 4, 3] or [4, 1, 3, 2] or any other wave form like structure.

Median of Two Sorted Arrays
Hard : Google, Microsoft, Amazon.
There are two sorted arrays A[] and B[] of size n each. Write a program to find the median of the array obtained after merging both sorted arrays, i.e., the merged array of size 2n.
Input A[] = [1, 3, 6], B[] = [2, 8, 12]
Median - 4.5
Explain : After merging the sorted arrays, we obtain the larger sorted array [1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12]. The total number of elements is 6, so the median is the average of the two middle elements, 3 and 6, which equals (3 + 6)/2 = 4.5.

Move all Zeroes to End of Array
Easy : Facebook, Amazon, Uber, LinkedIn, Bloomberg.
Given an array X[] of n integers, where some elements are zero and some elements are non-zero. Write a program to move all the zeroes to the end of the array. With non-zero number preserved their order.
Input: X[] = [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 4], Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0]

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Medium : Microsoft, Amazon, Morgan Stanley
Write a program to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Input: str = "abcbbcab", Output: 3
Explanation: There are three substrings of unique characters with the longest length of 3: "abc", "bca", and "cab". So the output is 3.

Majority Element in array
Medium : Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Yahoo.
Input: X[] = [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 4], Output: 0

let obj = {
firstname:'aayushi',
lastname:'kumar',
city:'pune',
state:'MH',
contact:'email',
working:true,
}
Now for the above object find if there is any 'email' text on either side of the object's attribute.
